# math-with-slack

This repo threads a json config into the math-with-slack extension. 
If a team of people clone this repo and run the extension routinely, they may all have LaTeX in slack with a common set of macros.
Take, for instance, how the current config allows the macro `\bbR` for the blackboard symbol `\mathbb{R}` (among others).

# usage

```shell
sudo python add-math.py
```
